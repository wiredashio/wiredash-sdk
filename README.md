## 3-Minute Quick Start

> It takes less than 180 seconds to integrate Wiredash in your existing app ðŸš€ <br />
> Visit [docs.wiredash.com](https://docs.wiredash.com/guide/start) for the in-depth
> guide and additional info.

### 1. Create an account and project

Start by visiting the Wiredash Console: [Wiredash Console](https://wiredash.com/console).
Create your free account using Google or GitHub or request an email sign-in link.

Then create a project with a descriptive name.

### 2. Add Wiredash to your pubspec.yaml

```bash
$ flutter pub add wiredash:^2.0.0
```

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ...
  wiredash: ^2.0.0
```

### 3. Wrap your root widget with Wiredash

Wrap the root widget of your existing app with Wiredash and make sure to fill in the `projectId` and SDK `secret`
from the [Wiredash Console](https://console.wiredash.com) > Your project >
Settings > General Settings.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wiredash/wiredash.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Wiredash(
      projectId: 'YOUR-PROJECT-ID',
      secret: 'YOUR-SECRET',
      child: MaterialApp(
        // Your Flutter app is basically Wiredash's direct child.
        // This can be a MaterialApp, WidgetsApp or whatever widget you like.
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

That's already it. Yes, it's *really that easy*.

### 4. (Optional) More features

#### Launch the feedback flow

Call the `Wiredash.of(context).show()` method from anywhere in your app to launch the Wiredash Feedback flow.

```dart
FloatingActionButton(
  onPressed: () {
    Wiredash.of(context).show(inheritMaterialTheme: true);
  },
  child: Icon(Icons.feedback_outlined),
),
```

  Wiredash.of(context).showPromoterSurvey(force: true);
  },
  child: Icon(Icons.feedback_outlined),
),
```
