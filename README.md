Wiredash is probably the easiest, and most convenient way to capture in-app user feedback, wishes, ratings and much
more. The SDK is completely written in Dart and runs on Android, iOS, Desktop and the Web. For more info, head over
to [wiredash.io](https://wiredash.io).

## 3-Minute Quick Start

> It takes less than 180 seconds to integrate Wiredash in your existing app ðŸš€ <br />
> Visit [docs.wiredash.io](https://docs.wiredash.io/guide/#integrating-wiredash-in-your-app) for the in-depth
> guide and additional info.

### 1. Create an account

Go to the [Wiredash Console](https://console.wiredash.io) and sign in with a valid Google or GitHub account. _It's
free!_<br />Click on `Create new project` and enter your app's name.

### 2. Add wiredash to your pubspec.yaml

```bash
$ flutter pub add wiredash:^1.8.0
```

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  ...
  wiredash: ^1.8.0
```

### 3. Wrap your root widget with Wiredash

Wrap the root widget of your existing app with Wiredash and make sure to fill in the `projectId` and SDK `secret`
from the [Wiredash Console](https://console.wiredash.io) > Your project >
Settings > General Settings.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wiredash/wiredash.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Wiredash(
      projectId: 'YOUR-PROJECT-ID',
      secret: 'YOUR-SECRET',
      child: MaterialApp(
        // Your Flutter app is basically Wiredash's direct child.
        // This can be a MaterialApp, WidgetsApp or whatever widget you like.
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### 4. Use any of Wiredash's amazing features

#### Launch the feedback flow

From anywhere in your app, call the `Wiredash.show()` method to launch Wiredash:

```dart
onTap: () {
  Wiredash.of(context).show(inheritMaterialTheme: true);
}
```

Checkout [examples/theming](https://github.com/wiredashio/wiredash-sdk/blob/stable/examples/theming/lib/main.dart) for the full example.

#### Launch the Promoter Score Survey

```dart
onTap: () {
  Wiredash.of(context).showPromoterSurvey(force: true);
}
```

Checkout [examples/promoter_score](https://github.com/wiredashio/wiredash-sdk/blob/stable/examples/promoter_score/lib/main.dart) for the full example

That's already it. Yes, it's *really that easy*. Also works on all platforms.
